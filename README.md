Python script to scan LHA files for WHDLoad integration in Amiberry

## About The Amiberry XML Builder

The Amiberry XML Builder is an automated tool which will routinely scan for available Amiga WHDLoad Packs (Games) and pre-set various options to be used in conjunction with the Amiga emulator Amiberry to aid with games compatibility and usability. This tool will be storing the end results in an output XML file named after whdload_db.xml.
